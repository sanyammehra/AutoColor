UsingTrainedModel.ipynb : Loads a model trained on tiny image net and tests. Saved model is stored in models folder
ComplexPokemon2.ipynb : run on image net using HSV. shows that SV euclidean distance loss is not a good measure
FirstModel.Ipynb : pass in hue component instead of luminance component. Its like a painting.
BasicWorking.ipynb : model trained on image net with RGB euclidean distance. Gives good results. This model is stored in Trained models
BaselineModel.ipynb : Just a helper file to get the basic code working

NEED to rename this files so that they depic what exactly is in them.. :(
